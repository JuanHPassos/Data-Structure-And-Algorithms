# Knowledge Sharing

In the stditem folder, you will find some of the data structures implemented this semester, such as stacks, queues, deques, lists (linked, sequential, doubly linked, and with head nodes), as well as binary search trees, AVL trees, and left-leaning red-black trees. All these structures are implemented using the item ADT, which is a structure that stores an integer and a void pointer. This pointer can be linked to any type the user prefers, expanding the use of the ADT without requiring changes to the code. It is worth noting that, because of this flexibility, it is necessary to manage the item carefully, including allocating and deallocating it properly.
